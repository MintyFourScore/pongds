# pongds
Repository with the code for my pong clone on the DS. Feel free to look around!

This is a beginners project I'm using to learn how to make DS games, don't use this as a guidelines
or even a template to make a DS game. It's here if you want to fork and add your own improvements or
even contribute, for some reason.

I am NOT a professional programmer and in reality a hobbyist.
